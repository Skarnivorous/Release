# Balance

Balance allows you to set the left and right audio channel volumes of the active audio device when it was opened.
There seems to be a lack of applications or utilities to provide this simple function.

## Features

- Adjust left and right audio channel volumes independently.

### Prerequisites

- .NET 9.0 Runtime [https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet)

### Installation

The application does not need to be installed.
You can download the latest compiled version of Balance from the [Releases](https://github.com/Skarnivorous/Releases/releases) page.
Unzip and execute Balance.exe.

## Usage

Use the vertical sliders to adjust the left and right audio channel volumes.
When you close the application the volumes will restore to balance level 100 in both channels.
